After boot-strapping the Tower configuration from bottom up you are ready to start a job in your Tower cluster. In one of your Tower nodes web UI’s:

  - Open the **Templates** view

  - Look for the **Install Apache** Template you created with the script

  - Run it by clicking the rocket icon.

At first this is not different from a standard Tower setup. But as this is a cluster of active Tower instances every instance could have run the job. And the Job output in Tower’s web UI doesn’t tell you where it run, just the instance group.

## So what Instance run the Job?

In one of the Tower instances web UI under **ADMINISTRATION** go to the **Instance Groups** view. For the `tower` instance group, the **TOTAL JOBS** counter shows the number of finished jobs. If you click **TOTAL JOBS** you’ll get a detailed list of jobs.

To see on what instance a job actually run go back to the **Instance Groups** view. If you click **INSTANCES** under the **tower** group, you will get an overview of the **TOTAL JOBS** each Tower instance in this group executed. Clicking **TOTAL JOBS** for an instance leads to a detailed job list.

## But I just want to know on which Instance my Job Run!

But it would still be nice to see where a job run (not the other way round) and to get an idea how jobs are distributed to the available instances. For this we can utilize the API:

  - First find the job ID: In the web UI access **VIEWS→Jobs**

  - The jobs names are prefixed with the job ID, example **3 - Install
    Apache**

  - With the ID you can query the API for the instance/node the job was
    executed on

Bring up the terminal in your VSCode session and run:

{{% notice warning %}}
Replace **\<ID>** with the job ID you want to query and **{{< param "student" >}}** and **{{< param "labid" >}}** with your values, you should be used to this by now!
{{% /notice %}}

    [student@ansible ~]$ curl -s -k -u admin:{{< param "secret_password" >}} https://{{< param "internal_tower1" >}}/api/v2/jobs/<ID>/ | python -m json.tool | grep execution_node

        "execution_node": "{{< param "internal_tower1" >}}",

{{% notice tip %}}
You can use any method you want to access the API and to display the result, of course. The usage of curl and python-tool was just an example.
{{% /notice %}}

## Via API in the browser

Another way to query the Tower API is using a browser. For example to have a look at the job details (basically what you did above using curl and friends):

{{% notice tip %}}
Note you used the internal hostname above, when using your browser, you have to use the external hostname, of course.
{{% /notice %}}

  - Find the job ID

  - Now get the job details via the API interface:

      - Login to the API with user `admin` and password `{{< param "secret_password" >}}`: `https://{{< param "external_tower" >}}/api/`
      - Open the URL `https://{{< param "external_tower" >}}/api/v2/jobs/<ID>/` where `<ID>` is the number of the job you just looked up in the UI.
      - Search the page for the string you are interested in, e.g. `execution_node`

{{% notice tip %}}
You can of course query any Tower node.
{{% /notice %}}

## Via Web UI

Starting with Ansible Tower 3.6, we can also find the information in the Web UI.

- Navigate to the **Jobs** menu

- Click on the job you just started

You will find the Ansible Tower node name in the field **Execution Node**.
