## OPTIONAL EXERCISE

You have used the Tower API a couple of times in this lab already. In
this chapter we’ll describe two ways to discover the Tower API if you
need to dive in deeper. While the [principles of the Tower
API](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/towerapi/index.html)
are documented and there is an [API reference
guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/towerapi/api_ref.html#/),
it’s often more efficient to just browse and discover the API.

## Browsing and Using the Tower API interactively

The Tower API is browsable, which means you can just click your way
through it:

1.  Go to the Tower UI in your browser and make sure you’re logged in as
    admin.

2.  Replace the end of the URL with `/api` e.g.
    `https://tower2-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com/api`

3.  You’re now in the API, notice that there are two versions. v1 will
    be retired soon so go to v2.

4.  While in `/api/v2`:

      - you see a list of clickable object types

      - on the right upper side, there is a button **OPTIONS** which
        tells you what you can do with the current object in terms of
        API.

      - next to it there is a **GET** button which allows you to choose
        between getting the (raw or not) JSON output or the API format,
        which you’re currently admiring by default.

5.  Click on the `/api/v2/users/` link and discover some more features:

      - There is a list of all objects of the given type

      - Each individual object can be reached using the `url` field
        ("url": "/api/v2/users/1/",)

      - Most objects have a `related` field, which allows you to jump
        from object to object

      - At the bottom of the page, there is a new field which allows you
        to *post* a new object, so let’s do this and create a new user
        name John Smith (user name doesn’t matter)


<details><summary>**>> Click here for Solution <<**</summary>
<p>
The JSON should roughly look like this:
```JSON
    {
        "username": "jsmith",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Smith",
        "email": "jsmith@example.com",
        "is_superuser": false,
        "is_system_auditor": false,
        "password": "redhat"
    }
```
and the result should be a 201 telling you about your success. You can
log-in with the password and see that you see… nothing, because you have
no rights.
</p>
</details>

Now log in again as admin and go back to the list of users:
**https://tower2-&lt;GUID&gt;.rhpds.opentlc.com/api/v2/users/**

  - Click on the **url** field of your new friend John Smith and notice
    a few more things:

      - There is a red **DELETE** button at the top right level. Guess
        for what?

      - At the bottom of the page, the dialog shows **PUT** and
        **PATCH** buttons.

So why not patch the user to be named "Johnny" instead of "John"?

<details><summary>**>> Click here for Solution <<**</summary>
<p>
Add this to the **CONTENT** field:
```JSON
    {
        "first_name": "Johnny"
    }
```
And press the **PATCH** button.
</p>
</details>

Now try to **PUT** **last\_name** "Smithy" using the same approach. What
happens?

<details><summary>**>> Click here for Solution <<**</summary>
<p>
Enter this into the **CONTENT** field and press **PUT**:
```JSON
    {
        "last_name": "Smithy"
    }
```
This will fail. In the case of **PUT** you need to enter all mandatory
fields, even if you don’t want to modify them:
```JSON
    {
        "username": "jsmith",
        "last_name": "Smithy"
    }
```
</p>
</details>

When you’re done press the red **DELETE** button and remove Johnny
Smithy.

## Using awx to Learn the API

The Web UI is nice but we love the command line, right? To learn about
API calls `awx` comes to the rescue. For the next steps bring up an
SSH session and make sure you are user root on **control.example.com**.

Let’s start simple and try to get the version of Tower installed:

```bash
    [root@ansible ~]# awx version --verbose
    Tower CLI 3.3.0
    API v2
    GET https://tower2.example.com/api/v2/config/
    Params: {}

    Ansible Tower 3.4.1
    Ansible 2.7.5
```

You see that with the `--verbose` option, awx tells us which API
calls it’s making, what **parameters** it’s sending with **GET**
requests and what **data** is needed for **POST** actions.

In this simple case you can simply take the call and run it with e.g.
**curl**:

```bash
    [root@ansible ~]# curl -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --user admin:MYSECRETPWD \
            --data '{}' \
            -X GET https://tower1.example.com/api/v2/config/ | jq
```

{{% notice tip %}}
`jq` is optional but useful for us humans to understand the output without getting dizzy… in this case it comes from the EPEL repo. If you don’t have `jq` appending `| python -m json.tool` to the command is better then nothing.
{{% /notice %}}

### Practice, Practice…

Using `awx` to learn about the API call and executing it via curl
e.g. in scripts is really useful so let’s practice a bit. What about
creating a new user, say Albert Miller?

{{% notice tip %}}
Consider that the parameters shown by awx are in Python format (single quotes and the unicode `u`) but we need to send data in JSON format (double quotes).
{{% /notice %}}

First create the user with awx, then delete it again. Use
`--verbose` to get the API invocation.

```bash
    [root@ansible ~]# awx user create --username amiller --email amiller@example.com --password redhat --verbose

    *** DETAILS: Checking for an existing record. *********************************
    GET https://tower2.example.com/api/v2/users/
    Params: {'username': u'amiller'}

    *** DETAILS: Writing the record. **********************************************
    POST https://tower2.example.com/api/v2/users/
    Data: {'username': u'amiller', 'password': u'redhat', 'email': u'amiller@example.com'}

    [root@ansible ~]# awx user delete --username amiller --verbose

    *** DETAILS: Getting the record. **********************************************
    GET https://tower2.example.com/api/v2/users/
    Params: {'username': u'amiller'}

    DELETE /users/3/
    DELETE https://tower2.example.com/api/v2/users/3/
```

Now we’ll do the same using **curl** with the API endpoints, parameters
and data we have learned from `awx`:

{{% notice warning %}}
The "Getting the record" is (sadly) a bit misleading… you need to add `?username=amiller` to filter on the username:
{{% /notice %}}

Check if the user exists:

```bash
    [root@ansible ~]# curl -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --user admin:r3dh4t1! \
            -X GET https://tower1.example.com/api/v2/users/?username=amiller
```

Once you’ve found out that the user doesn’t exist by **count:0** in the
reply, you can create it:

```bash
    [root@ansible ~]# curl -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --user admin:r3dh4t1! \
            --data '{"username": "amiller", "password": "redhat", "email": "amiller@example.com"}' \
            -X POST https://tower1.example.com/api/v2/users/?username=amiller
```

Run the `curl` command from above again to check the user now exists, it
should return **count:1** and the user’s data.

Note the ID of the user and then delete it:

{{% notice warning %}}
Replace **&lt;ID&gt;**
```bash
    [root@ansible ~]# curl -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --user admin:r3dh4t1! \
            -X DELETE https://tower1.example.com/api/v2/users/<ID>/ #
```
Don’t forget the slash at the end of the URL, favorite error\!
